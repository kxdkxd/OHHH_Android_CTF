 The project itself is just a simple hash solving problem. But in the real situation, I performed a Dex-to-C move, to execute Smali instruction in JNI.
 Also, a small function is obfuscated with o-llvm, with switch -sub -fla -bcf enabled. But the function is so small that you can try to understand it manually, also a real demo of o-llvm obfuscated context.
